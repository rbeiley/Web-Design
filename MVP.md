Done so far:

1. Basically so far I have created a firebase collection of countries and their different level lengths and characteristics etc.
2. I have also created the working doodle jump game that you go into when you click on a country to conquer.
3. Also, each user has their own account which keeps track of the countries they have counquered etc.
4. also, I have 3 different screens, one main menu where you choose your user, one with the world map and all the level(conquerable countries), and the last one is the actual doodle jump game you go into when you go to conquer a country

Need to do:

1. (do first, maybe 1 class periods) I need to make the game so that you choose an original country to start with and then go and conquer each country touching it. Right now, you just log into the game and can conquer any country you click on, but I want people to choose a country to start with, and then only be able to conquer Countries that are touching a country they have conquered
2. (do second, should take a little bit longer, maybe 2-3 class periods) Also, maybe change the map from a basic 2d image of the world to a 3d globe which you can spin and click on etc.
3. Encorporate the globe so that you can click on the countries directly and operate it
